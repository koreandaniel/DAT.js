## DAT.js

This library implements a Double Array Trie (DAT) System in JavaScript. A Double-Array Trie is a structure designed to make the size compact while maintaining fast access with algorithms for retrieval. Read more about it [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/31365/).

Designed as a library to support my DAT-AC algorithm, this library naturally provides support for the aho-corasick algorithm, but keeps the more traditionally linked list trie when building the double array trie.
